The BASIC Engine is a low-cost single-board home computer with advanced 2D color graphics and sound capabilities, roughly comparable to late-1980s or early-1990s computers and video game consoles. It is powered by an ESP8266 and has the same form factor as a Raspberry Pi. I hacked one into a Cherry Keyboard to complete the microcomputer asthetic and function.

# Procedural Snowflake Generator

I wrote this little program to generate snowflake like patterns that I could plot on holiday postcards. It will draw a snowflake and ask if you want to save it as a gcode file. If you hit 'Y' it will write the gcode to a file in the same directory as the program and then ask if it should save a .pcx image of the snowflake as well. It names the corresponding files as X_snowflake.gcode & X_snowflake.pcx
