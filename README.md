The BASIC Engine is a low-cost single-board home computer with advanced 2D color graphics and sound capabilities, roughly comparable to late-1980s or early-1990s computers and video game consoles. It is powered by an ESP8266 and has the same form factor as a Raspberry Pi. I hacked one into a Cherry Keyboard to complete the microcomputer asthetic and function.
